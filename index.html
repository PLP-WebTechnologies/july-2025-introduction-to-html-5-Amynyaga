      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello. I'm <strong>Amy Nyaga</strong>, a software engineer with a passion for transforming ideas into elegant, user-friendly digital solutions. I thrive on the creative challenge of blending thoughtful design with functional, maintainable code.</p>
      <p>My journey into coding began with redesigning a simple personal blog. What started as a weekend hobby grew into a full-fledged love for building responsive websites and intuitive applications. Today, I enjoy working on projects that simplify life, spark curiosity, or simply make the web more beautiful and accessible.</p>

      <h2>Why I Love Coding</h2>
      <p>To me, coding feels like solving a puzzle where creativity meets logic. Each project is a chance to learn, experiment, and create something meaningful. I love how even small design choices—like the placement of a button or the tone of microcopy—can make a real difference in user experience. That's what keeps me excited to code every day!</p>
